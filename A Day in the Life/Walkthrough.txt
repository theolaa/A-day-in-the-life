Project Name: A Day in the life... 
Author: Theo Laanstra
Date: March/April 2018
Lines of Code: 2,740

OPTIONAL: You can run the game the included Game.bat file. It opens up the game in a nicely styled Command Prompt window 
to properly suite the Text Based Adventure style of the game. Otherwise, just load the project in Eclipse 
and use their console, but you won't get the stylization.

Commands can be partially entered, but item names cannot. INV = INVENTORY, CLOTH != CLOTHES
I will shorten some commands here for simplicity.
