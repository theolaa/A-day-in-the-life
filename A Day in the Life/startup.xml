				You are in your living room.
				A single lazy-boy recliner sits against the wall, and an

				Takeout containers and beer cans litter	the ground.
				Some items sit on the desk in the corner.
				Sunlight seeps in through a crack in the window drapes.
				
				There is a door leading to the BEDROOM behind you.

			<description>
				You step out into a grand atrium. The exterior of the building certainly doesn't let on the
				grandeur contained within. A domed glass skylight lets golden rays of sun spill across the central
				waiting area. The walls and supporting columns appear to be made of a milky white marble with golden
				inlays in intricate patterns. Looking up, you can see balconies encircling the open area for each of the
				five stories. It really is an impressive sight to behold.
				
				In front of you is the RECEPTION DESK.
				Behind you is the way you came in, through the SECURITY CORRIDOR.
				To your left are the main floor WASHROOMS.
				To your right is the ELEVATOR up to the floor that your office is on.

				handles, fittings, faucets, and lighting fixtures.

				You step into the elevator. Not surprisingly, it is outfitted with the same
				taste and expense as the rest of the building. You tap your security pass, and the
				doors close with a hiss. You feel slightly heavier as the elevetor begins its ascent.
				
				Suddenly, the main lighting shuts down and you are left in the red glow a single emergency
				light set into the ceiling. An alarm starts to sound.
				
				You hear the shriek of tearing steel and your stomach lurches up into your throat as the
				floor drops from under you. You slam into the roof of the now free falling elevator.
				
				Suddenly everything stops and you slam equally hard against the elevator floor.
				Picking yourself up, you see that the mangled elevator doors in front of you leave just enough room
				to slip through them.
				
				The elevator DOORS are in front of you.

				You swipe the manager card an the blast doors open with a pneumatic hiss. It's another elevator.
				You step in hesitantly, remembering your recent experiences with elevators,
				and the doors close with a thud. Again you get that heavy feeling as you rise.
				
				Finally, the elevator reaches its destination without incident. The doors part slowly. 
				Blinding daylight streams through the doorway, and you shield your eyes with 
				your hand as you pass through.
				
				You can see that you have passed through a secret panel on th back wall of the cafe by your office.
				It is deserted, just like your office building. In fact, now that you think about it, you haven't seen
				anybody today except for the bus driver this morning. This is very odd. 
				
				You think to yourself "I must be dreaming!".
				
				And that does it.
				
				The sunlight intensifies until your vision is entirely white.
